"""The mesh proxy connection, as a Home Assistant device.

The integration holds one GATT link, to whichever node advertises this
network's Network ID, and that link occupies a Bluetooth **connection slot** on
the ESPHome proxy routing it for as long as it is held. Until this platform
existed, nothing in Home Assistant said which BLE address that was: every mesh
device is keyed on the network UUID plus a unicast address (see
:class:`~.light.MeshLight`) and carries no ``connections`` at all.

That absence has a cost outside this integration. A tool doing slot accounting
resolves a held address to a Home Assistant device and judges the link from that
device's entities; finding no device, it can only fall back to guessing from how
long the link has been quiet -- and a mesh proxy link is legitimately quiet for
hours, because it carries traffic only when something on the mesh changes. On
2026-08-28 that produced a stuck-slot report against this network's proxy link
which had been healthy the whole time.

So this platform is deliberately two things at once, and the second is the
point:

* it **names the address** on a device, so the link is resolvable; and
* it **goes unavailable exactly when the link does**, because it tracks
  ``coordinator.available`` like every other entity here -- so a reader gets a
  real health signal instead of a silence it has to interpret.

Naming the address without the second half would be worse than doing nothing: a
device whose entities never report trouble reads as permanently healthy, which
would turn one wrong alarm into a permanent blind spot.

The device is keyed on the **network**, never on a node. A mesh reaches many
nodes through one proxy, and Home Assistant treats ``connections`` as identity --
claiming the same BLE connection on several devices invites the registry to
merge them.
