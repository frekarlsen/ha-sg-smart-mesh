    Until 0.5.1 the Light CTL temperature mirror was applied to every Häfele
    lamp unconditionally. It is now a stored per-lamp option, because issue #7
    showed the quirk varies within a vendor. Letting that option default to
    empty would invert the colour temperature of every working install on
    upgrade, unasked — so the first setup that finds no option writes today's
    behaviour out as data, where the user can see it and uncheck it.

    Keyed on the option being ABSENT, never on it being falsy: an empty list is
    a user who deliberately unchecked every lamp, and re-seeding them would put
    the mirror back on every restart with nothing anywhere to say so.

    Deliberately once. A lamp imported later arrives unmirrored whatever its
    CID, which is the honest default now that the CID is known not to predict
    the quirk; seeding newly-seen nodes instead would need a second stored set
    (the nodes already seeded) to avoid the very bug described above.

    Only an entry that predates the option reaches the seed: since 0.10.3 the
    import flow creates the entry with the option present and empty. Until
    then a FRESH install looked exactly like an old one here, and had every
    Häfele colour-temperature lamp pre-ticked on the strength of the rule
    issue #7 disproved.
