"""Tests for the mesh proxy sensor.

The integration holds one GATT link, to whichever node advertises the network's
Network ID. That link occupies a Bluetooth *connection slot* on an ESPHome proxy
for as long as it is held, but nothing in Home Assistant said which BLE address
it belongs to: every mesh device is keyed on the network UUID plus a unicast
address, and carries no `connections` at all.

So a slot-accounting tool could see the address held and find no device for it.
BlueSight reported this network's proxy link as a stuck slot for hours while it
was perfectly healthy -- it had no way to tell "silent because nothing changed on
the mesh" from "silent because it is wedged", the device being invisible to it.

This entity closes that: it names the address on the device, and it goes
unavailable exactly when the link does, so a reader can judge the slot from a
real signal instead of guessing from idle time.

A fake coordinator and a fake device registry stand in for the real ones; no BLE
and no `hass` are touched.
