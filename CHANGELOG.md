# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-27

First release of the **SG Smart 3.0** fork (frekarlsen/ha-sg-smart-mesh).

### Added

- **SG Smart 3.0 dimmers** (LEDDim Smart Pill 3.0): a light with brightness
  through SG's vendor protocol, status read back from the dimmer, including
  changes made with a wheel or at the wall.
- **Minimum level** per dimmer, as a slider on the device page and the
  `set_min_level` action: HA's 1–100 % is spread over the range the load
  actually lights in. Adjusting it is live.
- **Dimmer wheels / switches**: an event entity (`press`, `hold`,
  `rotate_up`, `rotate_down` with `steps`) and a battery voltage sensor.
  A switch is recognised on its first button event.
- **Direct pairing** of a wheel to a dimmer (the dimmer stores it), from the
  Configure menu or the `pair_switch` / `unpair_switch` actions.
- **Device management in the Configure menu**: add a device (PB-GATT
  provisioning through the Bluetooth proxy, then key, bindings and
  publication), remove a device (factory reset over the mesh, unpairing a
  wheel from every dimmer first, retiring its address), and back up the
  network to `/config`.
- Actions for finishing or investigating a node: `configure_node`,
  `get_composition`, `send_raw`; every decrypted message is also fired as a
  `bluetooth_mesh_message` event.
- Protocol notes: `docs/sg-smart-3-protocol.md`.

### Fixed

- **Proxy configuration used the wrong nonce.** Proxy filter PDUs were sealed
  with the network nonce instead of the proxy nonce (Mesh Profile §3.8.5.4).
  Häfele lamps tolerated it; SG nodes drop it, keep an empty filter and
  forward nothing back, so no status ever arrived.
- A Mesh Configuration Database export's provisioner (e.g. the nRF Mesh phone)
  no longer shows up as a phantom light, a node without composition is kept
  rather than skipped, and a node's plain `name` field is used.

## [0.10.3] — 2026-09-24

Five robustness fixes from the second full read of the integration. None of
them changes what a working setup does day to day.

### Fixed

- **A new install no longer pre-ticks every Häfele lamp as inverted.** The
  per-lamp colour-temperature option is seeded once from the old vendor rule
  for entries that predate it, so that an upgrade flips nothing. A brand new
  entry looked exactly like one of those, so every Häfele colour-temperature
  lamp of a fresh install arrived mirrored, on the very guess issue #7 proved
  wrong. The import now creates the entry with no lamp ticked. Existing
  entries are untouched.
- **The options form can be saved again after a lamp leaves the export.** A
  lamp ticked as inverted and then removed from a re-imported `.connect`
  file stayed selected in a list that no longer showed it, and Home Assistant
  refused every save of the form, keep-alive and source address included. The
  form now only preselects lamps it lists, and keeps the hidden address on
  save rather than dropping a choice nobody could see.
- **The "proxy stuck" repair gives way when the lamp disappears.** It names a
  proxy that hears the lamp and refuses it. Once nothing hears the lamp any
  more (unplugged, out of range), that no longer holds, but the repair stayed
  on screen and kept sending people to restart a proxy. It is now replaced by
  the ordinary "unreachable" repair, with its list of what Home Assistant
  hears.
- **A proxy that drops off Wi-Fi is no longer taken for one that restarted.**
  The wait imposed by a stuck proxy's refusals is lifted when that proxy comes
  back, which Home Assistant only shows as a new registration. A proxy that had
  merely vanished from Home Assistant counted as well: the wait and the record
  of its refusals were wiped the moment it disappeared, before anyone knew
  whether it would come back healthy. They now last until it registers again.
- **Moving the sequence counter to its new file can no longer lose it.** The
  move made in 0.10.0 deleted the old file before writing the new one; a
  failed write in between restarted the counter at zero, and the lamps then
  drop every command as a replay until it climbs back. The old file is now
  deleted only once the new one is written.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-09-24

What Home Assistant shows now matches what the lamps are doing in three cases
where it did not, all found by the second full read of the integration.

### Fixed

- **A room no longer shows a change that never reached a lamp.** A mesh group
  shows the command on its members at once, before sending its single
  message, so the whole room moves together. When there was no connection to
  send it on, that was the only thing that happened, and the members stayed
  on screen as switched over dark lamps. The members are now put back when the
  message could not leave.
- **A room that mixes dimmers with on/off-only relays switches the relays
  too.** A brightness change was sent as a Light Lightness message alone, which
  a relay has no way to hear: it was shown on and stayed off. Such a room now
  also sends Generic OnOff, first: the other way round, a dimmer already lit
  by the brightness would jump to its default level when the on/off message
  arrived. A room of dimmers only still takes a single message.
- **A change made from the vendor app is now read back after every
  reconnection, not only after an outage.** With a timed keep-alive, the mode
  meant for sharing the lamps with the app, Home Assistant hands the lamp back
  after the idle time; a lamp changed from the app in between kept its old
  state here until someone touched it from Home Assistant. Every lamp now
  re-reads itself whenever a new connection is made, which is exactly when the
  app may have been using the lamp.

  This reverses a rule from 2026-07-26, when the integration connected for
  every single command and a read per connection meant a read per click. The
  connection is held now, so a new one is rare: after a drop, or after a timed
  keep-alive handed the lamp back. A command sent over the held connection
  still reads nothing back. The cost, with a timed keep-alive, is one short
  read per lamp at the first command after the idle time.

### Changed

- The keep-alive option now says what a timed keep-alive costs in return: to
  keep the lamp's single slot free, Home Assistant does not probe it in the
  background, so a lamp switched off at the wall shows as available until the
  next command fails.

Not run on a real mesh: the two room fixes, since the maintainer's network has
no room or group. Covered by tests that fail on 0.10.1.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-09-23

Two fixes to what 0.10.0 introduced, both found by a second read of the whole
integration.

### Fixed

- **The *restart the proxy* repair no longer sends you looking for a button
  that is not there.** It said an ESPHome proxy has a *Restart* button on its
  device page. The ready-made Bluetooth proxy firmware from ESPHome has none:
  its device page shows *Safe Mode Boot* and *Factory reset*, and someone
  looking for a restart could press the second one, which does not clear the
  condition and can erase the Wi-Fi settings the proxy was set up with. The
  repair now says to cut the proxy's power for a few seconds, that a
  *Restart* button works too if your own configuration defines one, and not to
  press *Factory reset*. It also stops asserting that the proxy has a free
  connection slot, which is not always known.
- **Home Assistant 2025.8 with a local Bluetooth adapter no longer loses the
  mesh after its first reconnect.** 0.10.0 reads each Bluetooth scanner's own
  record of when it last heard the lamp. On Home Assistant 2025.8, the oldest
  version this integration supports, only ESPHome proxies keep that record; a
  Bluetooth adapter plugged into the Home Assistant machine does not, until
  2025.9. The read raised on every reconnect through such an adapter, outside
  any error handling, which stopped the retry loop for good: the lights stayed
  unavailable until Home Assistant was restarted, and the diagnostics download
  failed too. A scanner that keeps no record is now skipped. Nothing changes
  on Home Assistant 2025.9 and later, nor for anyone who reaches the lamps
  through ESPHome proxies only.

  Not reproduced on a real setup: the maintainer runs a current Home Assistant
  and ESPHome proxies only. Covered by a test that fails with the exact error
  on 0.10.0.

The 0.10.0 notes below are also corrected. They said *everything ran on a real
mesh*, which was not true of two items, and one line still called the stuck
proxy fix open in the release that shipped it.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-20

Eight defects found by reading the whole integration again, none of them
reported by anyone, and all three fixes of #31. Everything below ran on the
maintainer's own mesh before release, except the two items that say they
could not.

### Added

- **Home Assistant now says which Bluetooth proxy to restart when one is
  wedged.** Third and last fix of
  [#31](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/31). A proxy can
  get stuck on one address: it refuses every connection in about a second,
  while it hears the lamp perfectly and has a connection slot free, and only
  restarting that proxy clears it. It has happened three times
  (2026-09-08, 2026-09-12, 2026-09-20), and each time it cost an hour of
  reading logs by hand to work out that the lamp was not the problem.

  That signature is now recognised, and the repair names the proxy and says to
  restart it instead of talking vaguely about an unreachable network. It is
  raised only when the lamp has exactly ONE connectable path: Home Assistant
  picks the path itself and never reports which one it used, so with several
  proxies in range the refusal cannot be pinned on any of them, and sending
  someone to restart a healthy proxy is worse than saying nothing. A slow
  failure, or a proxy with no free slot, is not a refusal and accuses nobody.

  Once the proxy is restarted, the wait its refusals had imposed goes with
  them: the integration reconnects within seconds instead of finishing a
  backoff that had grown to four minutes, which is what happened on 2026-09-20.

  Not seen in the field yet: provoking the wedge takes the lamp unplugged while
  the proxy holds its link. What did run live is the other half, a genuine
  10-second failure that was correctly not counted as a refusal.

### Fixed

- **A room stopped working once one of its lamps was disabled in Home
  Assistant.** A mesh group shows its members' state, so it pushes the command
  onto them before sending it. A lamp the user has disabled was never added to
  Home Assistant, writing its state raises, and the group's single message never
  left. Disabling the lamps to keep only the room is an ordinary thing to do.
  The disabled member is now skipped for the state write and still counted in
  what the room shows. The tests missed it because every one of them replaces
  that state write with a stub. Not run on a real mesh: the maintainer's
  network has no group. Covered by a test that failed before the fix.
- **Reloading the entry could leave the lamp's only connection held by the
  coordinator that had just been stopped.** A state read still waiting its turn
  when the entry reloaded carried on against the old coordinator, which
  reconnected. Nothing would ever release that link: its idle timer and its drop
  handler both stand down once stopped. The new coordinator then found the slot
  taken, backed off, and raised the *proxy unreachable* repair. A stopped
  coordinator now refuses to connect, and a light cancels its read when it is
  removed. A second notification no longer queues a second read behind one
  already in flight.
- **The two sequence numbers spent on every connection were not counted until
  a command followed.** Claiming the proxy filter is two network messages. A
  link that carried no command (a probe that hands the slot back, a reconnect
  after a drop) left the cursor where it was, and the next connection sent its
  own filter setup under the same two numbers, which a node is entitled to drop
  as replays. The cursor now follows the controller as soon as the link is up.
  Whether a Häfele lamp actually applies its replay list to these messages is
  not known; the fix costs nothing either way.

- **Removing the integration and adding it back no longer leaves every lamp
  deaf to it.** The nodes remember the highest sequence number they accepted
  from our address, and they do not forget it when Home Assistant forgets the
  entry. The cursor was stored under the config entry's id, so a re-added
  integration, which is the first thing anyone tries when something is wrong,
  started again at 0 and every command was dropped as a replay, without a word,
  until the cursor had climbed back past its old value. It is now stored under
  the network's identity and left in place on removal. A cursor stored the old
  way is moved on first start.
- **The sequence cursor on disk can no longer fall a whole safety margin
  behind.** Two holes. The margin added at startup was only written with the
  first debounced save, so a crash before it made the next start land on the
  same value and reuse what had been sent in between: it is now written before
  anything is sent. And the debounce pushes the write back on every call, so a
  burst (eight tunable-white lamps re-read after a reconnect is forty messages)
  wrote nothing until it was over: the cursor is now written at once whenever
  it is half a margin ahead of the disk. The comment claiming the window
  "cannot burn 32" was wrong.
- **An IV Index behind ours is ignored.** A lamp switched off at the wall
  during an IV Update comes back announcing the old index. Reaching the mesh
  through it made the integration adopt that index and restart its sequence
  cursor at 0, twice over: once under an index the mesh had left, then again
  under the current one, reusing numbers already spent. An IV Index only
  grows, and the spec has a node ignore such a beacon. One warning, then
  nothing.
- **Provisioning refuses its own confirmation and random sent back to it**
  (library only; provisioning is not reachable from Home Assistant yet, #12).
  A peer that does not know the AuthValue cannot compute a confirmation, but it
  can reflect ours, then our random, and the final check compared our value
  with itself. The reflected public key was already refused; these two were
  not.
- **A node gone quiet is no longer dialed anyway, and an automatic reconnect
  spends one connection attempt instead of four.** Two of the three fixes
  scoped in [#31](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/31),
  after the 2026-09-12 outage where Home Assistant's own path scoring was
  poisoned by our failed attempts against an unplugged node, and the eventual
  retries went through the worst proxy in range.

  A cached advert can read `connectable=yes` for minutes after the node stopped
  advertising, so a match nobody has heard for 30 s is now treated as silence:
  no attempt, no failure charged to a proxy. "Nobody" is meant literally.
  Home Assistant keeps one entry per address, owned by one proxy, and an owner
  gone deaf freezes its timestamp while another proxy still hears the node, so
  every scanner is asked before a node is called silent. One exception: a node
  does not advertise while its slot is held, so for 30 s after a link of ours
  ends the old advert is used as before. Without it the reconnect after a
  dropped link, the 2026-09-04 fix, would have missed every time. The
  *proxy unreachable* repair and the log now give each advert's age, so they no
  longer show our own network as `connectable=yes` next to "no connectable
  proxy".

  The automatic paths (startup probe, periodic retry, advert-triggered retry,
  reconnect after a drop) now always make a single attempt, where the first of
  an outage used to make bleak-retry-connector's four. A command keeps the
  four, except while backing off, where everything stays at one as it has been
  since 0.7.0.

  Validated live on 2026-09-20: with the lamp unplugged for three minutes, not
  one connection attempt was made. Item 3 (naming the stuck proxy) ships in
  this same release, see *Added*.

### Changed

- Stopped calling a Home Assistant device-registry method that is deprecated
  and disappears in 2027.8. The proxy sensor was looking its own device up to
  attach the Bluetooth address to it; Home Assistant hands every entity its
  device as it is added, so the lookup is gone rather than replaced.
- **The minimum Home Assistant version is 2025.8.0, and has been since
  v0.4.2.** `hacs.json` said 2024.11.0, but the options flow imports
  `OptionsFlowWithReload`, which first shipped in 2025.8.0 (checked against the
  core tags). On anything in between, HACS offered the install and the
  integration failed at import, which is the very thing that floor exists to
  prevent. CI runs the single core version the test harness pins, so nothing
  ever exercised the declared one.
- Removed what nothing read: two config keys left from before the config flow
  existed, two attributes of the light, a `call=None` reachability mode and a
  `now` parameter in the coordinator, and a teardown that could not have
  anything to tear down. The module docstrings of the coordinator and the light
  platform described a connect-per-command, one-entity-per-node design the code
  left several releases ago; they now describe what it does.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **A room or group the vendor app already built is now one light in Home
  Assistant, controlled with a single message.** Raised in
  [#30](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/30) after the
  element-per-output fix: toggling a Home Assistant `light.group` over two
  outputs switched them in a visible sequence, one full round trip after the
  other, where the vendor app's own group toggle moves both at once.

  The gap was not a missing protocol feature — the app already subscribed the
  member elements to a group address when the room/group was built, and the
  `.connect` export already carries it. Nothing here configures a mesh
  subscription; a new entity per group now simply addresses a single
  unacknowledged Set to that address instead of one acknowledged Set per
  member in turn. Tracked as [#33](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/33).

  A group light shows its members' state rather than keeping its own: on when
  any member is on, at their average brightness. In the first release candidate
  it only remembered what it had itself been told, so a room covering the same
  strips as a group showed *off* over two lit strips once the group had switched
  them on — reported on the reporter's own box, where the vendor app's room and
  group are the same two outputs. A group whose members all sit on one node is
  now listed under that node's device; one spanning several nodes stays without
  a device, since none of them is more its own than another.

  Covers on/off and brightness. Colour/CTL groups are not modelled yet — no
  hardware to validate against exists here either.

  Validated on the author's single-output lamp for the absence of change — no
  group exists there, so no new entity appears and the one light behaves as it
  did — and on the reporter's own two-strip box for the rest: the app's room and
  its group both move both strips at the same instant, both follow a member
  switched on its own, and a group whose members are deliberately driven apart
  reports their average (#33, confirmed 2026-09-17).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **A controller driving several lights now gives you all of them, not just
  the first.** Entities were created one per mesh *node*, and a multi-channel
  controller is a single node whose channels are its elements. Reported in
  [#30](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/30): a Häfele
  24 V box drives the two LED strips of a mirror from element 0 and element 1
  of one node, and only the top strip ever appeared. The bottom one was not
  misparsed and the radio was never at fault — nothing asked for it.

  Each element carrying its own Light Lightness server is now its own entity.
  That test matters: one lamp is free to lay its models out across several
  elements (Generic OnOff on one, Light Lightness and Light CTL on the next),
  and counting every element that answers an on/off opcode would have cut such
  a lamp in two, one half unable to dim and the other unable to switch on. A
  node that dims nothing falls back to its on/off servers, so a multi-channel
  relay gets one entity per channel too.

  **Nothing you already have is renamed.** A node with one lighting output —
  every lamp this project has been tested on — yields exactly the entity it
  did before, with the same unique id, addressed the same way across the whole
  node. The extra outputs of a multi-channel node arrive beside the first,
  sharing its device, each named after the output as the vendor app names it
  (the export ties each name to the element it drives) and falling back to
  `Output <address>` when the export says nothing. The controller's own entry
  no longer names the first output, which is how a two-strip box ended up with
  a strip called *MyHomeIsCool*.

  Validated on the author's single-output lamp for the absence of change, and
  on the reporter's own two-strip box for the rest: both outputs appear as
  separate controls, in the right order, and they stay in that order across a
  Home Assistant restart (#30, confirmed 2026-09-12).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **A command the lamp did not acknowledge is no longer shown as its state.**
  Every Set already returned what the node answered in its Status, or `None`
  when it answered nothing — and the light entity kept the optimistic state it
  had written before sending, whatever came back: the on/off and colour
  temperature answers were discarded outright, and a timed-out brightness
  simply stayed at the value asked for. On 2026-09-10 the author's node had
  stopped applying writes while still answering reads (a power-cycle cured it;
  the same thing had happened on 2026-09-08). The dashboard said *on* and
  *82 %* over a dark lamp, and not one line above debug said the node had
  answered nothing. The README promised "state is read, not assumed"; it was
  true of reads and false of every write that timed out.

  A tap still shows at once. Each attribute then settles on the node's answer
  — on/off as answered, brightness and colour temperature as reported — and
  falls back to its previous value when there is no answer, `unknown` staying
  `unknown`. A node that answers the opposite of what it was told is shown as
  it answered, with a warning. A node that stops answering gets one warning
  per such episode (`mesh node 0x000c did not acknowledge set_onoff; showing
  its last known state`) and one info line when it answers again; silence
  while the mesh is unreachable is left to the coordinator, which already
  reports it. Not hardware-validated on a node in that state — it cannot be
  produced on demand — but a node that answers is unchanged: every existing
  command test passes as before.

- **An unplugged lamp no longer fills the log with the same warning every
  fifteen seconds.** `no connectable mesh proxy for network_id …` warned on
  every probe, and probing carries on for as long as the link is down: while
  v0.7.0 was being validated on 2026-09-12 with the lamp unplugged, that one
  line wrote 49 warnings in twelve minutes, between 07:41 and 07:53. A miss is
  routine — the lamp is off, out of range, or the vendor app holds its single
  slot — and only the miss that crosses the unreachable threshold means
  anything: it is the one that takes the integration unavailable. That one
  still warns, exactly like the connect failure logged beside it; the misses
  either side keep the `0x1828` advert diagnostic at debug, unchanged, for
  whoever turns the logger up.

  Coming back now says so once, at info: `mesh proxy reachable again after N
  misses`. With the misses themselves down at debug, an outage would otherwise
  leave a beginning in the log and no end.

  The retry timing is untouched: a missing advert still does not widen the
  backoff, because nothing was attempted.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-12

### Changed

- **Keep-alive `0` now means *always connected*, not *held until it happens to
  drop*.** Two gaps made the shipped default slower than it claimed. The
  startup probe connected, recorded availability, then released the link
  regardless of the option — so the first click after every restart paid a
  full connect on top of a probe that had just succeeded. And a link that
  dropped on its own was only noticed at the next command: on 2026-09-04 the
  morning's first command paid 11 s, through the proxy habluetooth happened to
  prefer that minute (atomesalon at -94 dBm, the closer one still penalised
  for the night's failures).

  With keep-alive `0` the probe now keeps the link it brought up, and a drop
  reported by bleak's disconnected callback re-establishes it in the
  background. A *timed* keep-alive is untouched on both counts: that option
  exists to hand the lamp's single slot back to the vendor app, so a drop is
  welcome there and the probe still releases what it opened. The callback
  fires on the integration's own disconnects too; those are told apart by
  identity, since teardown clears the held client before disconnecting it.

  The first cut of that watchdog then lost a whole day on the author's
  network: the link dropped at 09:50, the one reconnect attempt found no
  0x1828 advert yet — the node had only just stopped being connected — and
  that single miss did not flip availability (three in a row are required, a
  hysteresis built for probes against a lamp that is often busy for a moment).
  Both recovery paths, the periodic probe and push discovery, act only while
  unavailable, so nobody reconnected until the evening's click paid the
  connect. A missing permanent link is now its own reason to recover: the
  probe runs on the fast interval and the next advert triggers a connect,
  whatever the availability flag says. Push discovery also no longer queues a
  probe behind a connect already in flight.

  Shutdown is left alone: Home Assistant closes the ESPHome links in its CLOSE
  stage, when the core is already `not_running`, and the watchdog checks that
  before chasing a link nobody wants back.

### Fixed

- **A node that is hammered never recovers, so consecutive connect failures now
  back off.** Three paths re-established a lost proxy link — push discovery on
  every 0x1828 advert a proxy sends, the 15 s probe, and the watchdog on a
  dropped keep-alive — and not one of them ever slowed down: each fired the
  moment the connect lock was free, and each attempt was bleak-retry-connector's
  four GATT connects. On 2026-09-10 a plain reload of the entry dropped the
  held link and started that storm; forty minutes and 61 failed connects later
  (BlueSight raised `kind: storm`) the node still refused everyone, the vendor
  app included, and a power-cycle of the node changed nothing because the storm
  resumed while it booted. Disabling the integration for 130 s, then enabling
  it, connected in 8 s. The node was never wedged: it never had a quiet moment.
  The 2026-09-08 incident, filed as "cause not isolated", was the same thing —
  what cleared it was the *disabling* that preceded the re-enable, not the
  re-enable. The BRC1H pairing storm in daikin_madoka is the same mechanism.

  A GATT failure now widens the wait before the next automatic attempt, from
  the 15 s retry interval doubling up to 5 min, and every automatic path honours
  it: an advert inside the wait starts nothing, and the probe tick is armed for
  whichever is longer, its interval or the remainder of the wait. While backing
  off each attempt is a single GATT try, not four. A miss that never reached
  the radio (no connectable proxy advertised) does not widen the wait — it put
  no pressure on the node, and the advert that ends it is the one to act on at
  once, as before. A successful connect clears the wait. One info line per step
  (`mesh proxy backoff: next connect attempt in N s`) tells the climb in the log.

  Validated on the author's lamp on 2026-09-12 (`v0.7.0-rc3` and `-rc4`): with
  the node unplugged, the wait climbed 15 → 30 → 60 → 120 → 240 → 300 s with
  exactly one attempt per window, and the first advert after plugging it back
  in reconnected at once. The rc3 run also caught a probe that had queued on
  the connect lock before the first failure and fired one second after it;
  the gate is now checked again once the lock is held.

- **A failed connect now says what failed, and says it out loud once.** The
  handler logged `logger.debug("mesh connect failed: %s", exc)`, and the
  `asyncio.timeout` guarding the connect raises a `TimeoutError` whose `str()`
  is the empty string — so the line printed `mesh connect failed:` and nothing
  after it. The one message that could have explained the 2026-09-05 stall,
  which only a Home Assistant restart cleared, carried no reason at all. The
  exception type is now part of the reason, and the message is appended only
  when it says something too.

  It was also the wrong level: a connect that fails takes the integration
  unavailable, exactly like the "no connectable proxy" miss logged beside it at
  warning. Only the miss that crosses `UNREACHABLE_THRESHOLD` warns — the ones
  below it are routine on a lamp with a single proxy slot, and since probing
  carries on for as long as the link is down, warning on every retry would bury
  the first one.

- **A Data Out subscribe that fails late no longer passes for a working link.**
  `GattBearer.start` waits one second for `start_notify` to confirm, then
  proceeds — some proxied backends deliver notifications without ever resolving
  the await, and blocking on them would hang every command. That grace period
  assumed the only late outcome was *slow*. On 2026-09-04 the proxy node
  answered the CCCD write with `Insufficient authorization (8)` **seven
  seconds after** the bearer had moved on, and the pending task swallowed it:
  the controller came up, the coordinator marked itself available, the light
  went optimistic, and every Set went into a connection the proxy had already
  dropped. Nothing in Home Assistant said so; the only trace was an
  `Error doing job: BleakError exception in shielded future` in the core log.

  The late result is now recorded in `GattBearer.failure`, and
  `MeshController.failed` mirrors it exactly as it mirrors a dead TX pump — so
  the coordinator's existing check tears the link down and the next command
  reconnects instead of reusing a handle that can neither send nor hear a
  Status. Why the node demanded authorization that night is a separate
  question this does not answer.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Colour temperature is read from the lamp.** It was the last attribute that
  only ever reflected the last command — on/off and brightness have been read
  since 0.2/0.3 — so a temperature changed from the vendor app or a wall remote
  never reached Home Assistant. The library gained the Get it was missing; its
  Status was already decoded.

  A lamp still ramping reports where it is *and* where it is going, and the
  answer is where it is going. That resolution already existed for every `set_*`
  and the getters inherit it rather than deciding again.

- **The lamp is asked for the Kelvin range it actually tracks.** The exposed
  range was a pair of constants, 2700–6500, chosen as a safe default. That put a
  lamp's real extremes out of reach, and it did something quieter as well: the
  inversion workaround mirrors around the **exposed** range, so on a lamp whose
  real limits are not 2700–6500 the mirror shipped in 0.5.1 was off-centre by
  twice the difference of the midpoints.

  The range is now read once — it is a property of the device, not a state — and
  both the slider and the mirror follow it. A lamp that really is 2700–6500, the
  typical tunable white, puts exactly the same bytes on the wire as before; a
  test asserts that rather than leaving it to chance. A lamp that reports no
  valid range keeps the default.

- **Diagnostics reports the range each CTL node claims.** `probe.nodes[].ctl_range`,
  null when the node gave none. Without it a lamp whose warm and cool land
  off-centre cannot be explained from a dump — the blind spot that cost a round
  trip on #7, one layer down.

### Changed

- A read temperature is **un-mirrored before display**. A marked lamp reports the
  value it was sent, so showing it raw would have put a wrong number in front of
  exactly the users the option exists for.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **Which lamps get their colour temperature mirrored is now chosen per lamp,
  not per manufacturer.** Issue #7 produced the lamp that disproves the old
  rule: a Häfele node showing warm white when Home Assistant said cool — the
  mirror this integration applies to every Häfele lamp was itself doing the
  inverting. Either that lamp is spec-conformant and we were wrong about it, or
  the vendor list was missing an entry, and no diagnostics dump can tell those
  two apart. Both readings agree on the same conclusion: the quirk varies
  *within* a manufacturer, by model or by firmware, so a company identifier
  cannot predict it.

  Settings → Devices & Services → *Bluetooth Mesh* → **Configure** now lists
  every colour-temperature lamp under **Lamps with inverted colour
  temperature**. Tick the ones that show warm when Home Assistant says cool;
  leave the rest, because mirroring a lamp that is already correct inverts warm
  and cool end to end. The same network can now hold both kinds, which the
  vendor list could not express at all.

  **Nothing changes on upgrade.** The first setup after updating writes the old
  rule into the new option — every Häfele lamp with a CTL server starts ticked —
  so an install that works today keeps working, and the setting is visible where
  it can be unticked. A lamp imported later arrives unticked whatever its
  manufacturer, which is the honest default now that the identifier is known not
  to predict the quirk.

### Added

- **Diagnostics names the mirrored lamps.** `state.inverted_ctl` lists the
  addresses whose temperature is mirrored before sending. Without it a report of
  a backwards lamp cannot say whether the inversion is the lamp's or ours — the
  ambiguity that cost a round trip on #7.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-28

### Added

- **The proxy connection is now a device, and its BLE address is on it.** The
  integration holds one GATT link, to whichever node advertises the network's
  Network ID, and that link occupies a Bluetooth *connection slot* on the
  ESPHome proxy routing it for as long as it is held. Nothing in Home Assistant
  said which address that was: every mesh device is keyed on the network UUID
  plus a unicast address and carries no `connections` at all.

  A new diagnostic sensor, `Proxy address`, closes that. It lives on a device
  keyed on the network — never on a lamp, since a mesh reaches many nodes
  through one proxy and Home Assistant treats `connections` as identity — and
  it writes the address it is actually connected through onto that device.

  The entity tracks `coordinator.available` like every other entity here, and
  that half is the point rather than a detail. Naming the address while never
  reporting trouble would read as permanently healthy and would trade one wrong
  alarm for a permanent blind spot; going unavailable exactly when the link does
  gives a slot-accounting tool a real signal to judge the held slot by, instead
  of guessing from how long the link has been quiet.

  A mesh proxy link is legitimately quiet for hours — it carries traffic only
  when something on the mesh changes — so that guess was wrong in practice: on
  2026-08-28 an external slot monitor reported this network's proxy link as a
  stuck slot while it had been healthy the whole time.

  The address is written with `new_connections`, which **replaces** the set. A
  mesh proxy advertises a *random static* address: stable while the node is
  powered, free to change when it is not. Accumulating every address seen would
  leave the device claiming BLE connections it no longer has, and a reader
  resolving a stale one would name this device for somebody else's slot.

## [0.4.8] — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **Setup failures and import errors are no longer English-only.** Two strings
  reached the user interface without passing through a translation. The
  `ConfigEntryError` raised when a stored `.connect` export cannot be read
  renders on the integration card, and it was built with an f-string, so a
  French install showed an English sentence there; it now carries the
  `corrupt_connect_export` translation key. The config-flow rejection reason
  was worse — the sentence around it was translated while the reason injected
  into it was hand-written English, producing a half-translated line.

  A paste that is not JSON at all and a well-formed document that is not an
  export are now two separate errors, `invalid_json` and `invalid_connect`,
  because their fixes differ: the first is usually a truncated or word-wrapped
  paste, the second is the wrong file. Only the parser's own detail stays in
  English — it names JSON fields that are English in the export itself.

  A test now compares the key set of every shipped translation against
  `strings.json`, so a key added to one file and forgotten in another fails
  the suite instead of silently rendering in English for that language.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **Reassembly is per source; two peers segmenting at once no longer destroy
  each other's transfer** ([#11](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/11)).
  `MeshNode` held a single `SegmentAssembler`, and the transfer identity it
  keyed on carried no source address. A segment from one node arriving
  mid-transfer from another did not interleave, it *reset*: the first node's
  partial reassembly was dropped and its acknowledgment timer cancelled with
  it. Neither message was ever delivered, and nothing anywhere said so.

  This was original Phase-0 behaviour, on the stated grounds that the stack
  talked to a single peer. That justification expired on both halves: the proxy
  address filter now lets Status traffic from any node reach us, and since
  0.4.6 we acknowledge segmented messages — which actively invites peers to
  send them.

  Reassembly state and both SAR timers are now held per source address. The
  table is bounded (`MAX_TRACKED_SEGMENT_SOURCES`), evicting an idle peer
  before one with a transfer in flight, and a stranded transfer is dropped
  outright when its incomplete timer expires rather than merely reset.

## [0.4.6] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- **The transport acknowledges segmented messages** (spec §3.5.3.3). `SegmentAck`
  had a parser and no builder: nothing anywhere emitted one. A peer that
  segments its reply and waits to be acknowledged therefore gave up, and the
  exchange failed with no error anywhere — the request timed out exactly as if
  the node had never received it ([#9](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/9)).

  Now a segmented message addressed to our own unicast is acknowledged the
  moment it is complete, which is the ack the sender is blocked on. An
  incomplete one arms the §3.5.3.3 acknowledgment timer (150 ms + 50 ms per TTL
  hop) and then reports the block-ack bitfield, so the peer retransmits the
  segment that is actually missing rather than the whole message; the
  incomplete timer abandons a stranded transfer after 10 s. A transfer that is
  already delivered is re-acknowledged rather than reassembled a second time —
  a peer whose ack was lost retransmits, and that must not surface as a
  duplicate message.

  Messages sent to a group or virtual address are deliberately **not**
  acknowledged: every subscriber would answer the sender at once.

  Nothing in the integration depended on this — every lighting command and
  Status fits in one segment, which is why it went unnoticed. It blocked the
  first device-keyed exchange that does not, which is why v0.4.4 had to abandon
  Config Composition Data as a reachability probe and fall back to Config Relay.

### Changed

- **The diagnostics probe no longer disowns its own `composition` field.**
  v0.4.4 shipped a note telling the reader that a null composition proves
  nothing, which was true then: the Status is segmented and nothing could ever
  complete it. It completes now, so on a node whose `answered` is true a null
  composition is a finding rather than an artefact of our transport, and the
  note says so.

### Fixed

- **A rejected `.connect` paste now says why.** The import and reconfigure forms
  collapsed a truncated paste, a file that is not an export at all, and an
  export whose every node is unparseable into one `invalid_connect` — three
  different problems with three different fixes, rendered identically. The
  parser's own message is carried through to the form.

- **A reassembly timer could outlive the connection.** `MeshController.stop()`
  now closes the node, so a pending acknowledgment cannot fire against a bearer
  that is already gone — which would have burned a persisted sequence number on
  an ack nothing could carry.

## [0.4.5] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- **The source address is configurable** (options flow, `0` = derive it). One
  thing a `.connect` export structurally cannot tell us is which unicast the
  vendor app gave *itself*: exports carry no provisioner node. If that address
  is the one we transmit from, every message we send is discarded as a replay by
  nodes holding a sequence number for it — before any model sees it, with
  nothing in any log to say so, and unaffected by re-importing the export.
  Moving off it was impossible until now; it is the last hypothesis standing in
  [#7](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/7).

  An address that is not a unicast, or that a node of the imported network
  already owns, is refused with a warning and the derived one is used instead —
  honouring it would mute the integration in exactly the way the option exists
  to escape.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **The 0.4.3 composition probe reported a false negative on a healthy node.**
  Run against the reference lamp — where on/off, brightness and state read-back
  all work — it answered `answered: false`. A Composition Data Status is
  segmented, and this stack transmits no Segment Acks (`SegmentAck` in
  `transport.py` is parse-only; `node.py` says so in its docstring), so a long
  status never completes and the node looks absent. As shipped, the probe
  invited exactly the wrong conclusion.

### Changed

- **Reachability is now a Config Relay Get.** Request and Status both fit in a
  single unsegmented message, so a silence is a real silence. It is device-keyed
  like before — no AppKey binding, no Light LC mode, no vendor model involved —
  so it still separates "the message never arrived" from "the node received it
  and did nothing". Its content earns its place too: a node with the Relay
  feature off forwards nothing from our proxy connection into the rest of the
  mesh, which is invisible from every other angle.
- **The composition is still requested, and now correctly framed.** It is the
  only place the node's own account of itself can be compared against the
  export, so it stays — but the dump states, in the dump, that a null
  composition proves nothing.

### Added

- `MeshController.get_relay()`, `Config Relay Get` / `Config Relay Status` in
  the access layer (opcodes verified against Zephyr's `foundation.h`).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **A composition probe in the diagnostics dump.** Every silent mesh failure
  conflates two questions — did the message reach the node, and did the node
  choose to act on it — and nothing in the dump could tell them apart. A
  `Config Composition Data Get` is answered by a node's Config Server under its
  **device key**, without consulting an AppKey binding, a Light LC mode or a
  vendor model. So an answer proves the round trip and points at the model
  layer; silence points at the transport. It also reports what each node says
  it *is*: the rest of the dump is the vendor app's account of the network,
  parsed from the export, and this is the only place the two can be compared.

  Bounded on purpose: skipped entirely when no proxy connection is held (a
  download must not spend the connect timeout dialling an absent proxy), capped
  at the first 6 nodes, and whatever is left out is reported rather than
  silently dropped.

- `MeshController.get_composition()` in the library, and every node's device key
  registered on the runtime node so Foundation-model traffic can be addressed
  to any of them.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-08-23

Four ways a command could be discarded without a word, and no way to tell them
apart. Reported in [#7](https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/issues/7):
the proxy connects, the frames go out, the lamp never reacts and nothing
answers. None of these is confirmed as that reporter's cause yet — all four are
real, all four look identical from the outside, and that is the actual defect.

### Fixed

- **A command is addressed to the element that hosts the model**, not to the
  node's primary address. An element silently ignores an opcode it has no model
  for — it neither acts nor answers — so a node that lays its lighting servers
  out across several elements took every command in silence. Light CTL
  Temperature was already routed this way; on/off, lightness and CTL now are
  too.
- **The application key is chosen from what the models bind.** A node matches
  an incoming message's AID against the keys each of its models was bound to
  and discards anything else at the upper transport layer. The export's first
  key was used on faith, which is wrong for any network holding more than one.
  Every key in the export is now parsed, and the one the driven models actually
  bind is the one commands are encrypted with.
- **The source address steps aside for a node that already owns it.** We
  transmit from unicast `0x7FFF`; if the export gives that address to a node,
  that node's peers already hold a replay-protection entry for it and drop
  everything we send — permanently, and re-importing the export does not help.
  The address is now taken from the export's free range instead of assumed.
- **A subnet that never beacons says so.** The `.connect` export carries no IV
  Index, so 0 is an assumption and the Secure Network Beacon is the only thing
  that can confirm it. Silence now produces one warning naming the unverified
  index, instead of nothing at all.
- **The deprecated config-entry update listener is gone.** Home Assistant stops
  honouring it in 2026.12. The options flow is an `OptionsFlowWithReload` and
  reloads the entry itself.

### Changed

- **A node whose lighting servers are not on element 0 now gets a light.**
  Capability detection always scanned every element; entity creation did not,
  so such a node was hidden entirely rather than exposed with fewer features.
  Server models only — a remote's client models still yield no entity.
- **Diagnostics answer the "why is nothing happening" question.** Added: the
  unicast we transmit from, the AppKey index in use next to the ones the export
  carries and the ones the models ask for, and each model's `bind` list. The
  per-element `models` entries are now objects (`{"id", "bind"}`) rather than
  bare strings.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Documentation caught up with the code. The README still described the 0.1.0
  integration, and both forum drafts carried a claim that had become false —
  "optimistic state: parallel changes from the vendor app aren't read back".
  On/off and brightness have been read from the mesh since 0.2.0; colour
  temperature genuinely is still last-command-wins, so that is what the stated
  limitation now says. The README also documents reading state, `unknown`
  instead of a guessed `off`, the reconfigure flow, diagnostics, and the
  corrected development commands.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **A reconfigure flow.** Networks change — a node is added, a key refreshed —
  and the only way to import the new export was to delete the entry and re-add
  it, losing every entity id and the history behind it. Pasting a *different*
  network is refused rather than silently repointing every entity.
- **Push discovery.** The integration recovers the moment a proxy for its
  network advertises again, instead of waiting out the retry tick.

### Changed

- **Setup no longer blocks on the first connect.** It awaited a full connect —
  up to the connect timeout plus retries — inside `async_setup_entry`, past the
  point where Home Assistant warns that an integration is slow to set up.
- **The SEQ cursor is written through a debounced store** instead of on every
  command: one flash write per button press wears out an SD card for nothing.
  It is flushed immediately when the entry unloads, and the safety margin
  applied at startup already covers whatever a crash leaves unwritten.
- `iot_class` is now `local_polling`. Nothing pushes: the integration
  subscribes to no unsolicited publication, it asks when the mesh becomes
  reachable.
- **ruff runs in CI**, pinned, and the test job no longer silently excludes the
  `phase0` harness suite. `hacs.json` declares a 2024.11.0 floor, so an older
  core is refused instead of failing at import.

### Fixed

- **A malformed node no longer sinks the whole import.** Exports come from
  another vendor's app; one node missing a field it never promised made the
  entire network unusable behind a flat "not a valid export". Unparseable nodes
  are skipped with a warning naming them — losing *every* node still fails,
  since an empty network would look like success.
- **A network without a `meshUUID` gets a stable identity.** The unique id fell
  back to an empty string, so any second such network aborted as already
  configured. `k3(NetKey)` — the Network ID nodes advertise — is used instead.
- **A damaged stored export fails the setup cleanly** with a message pointing
  at the reconfigure flow, instead of a raw traceback.
- **An unconfirmed GATT subscribe is cancelled when the bearer stops**, rather
  than left running against a client the caller is about to disconnect.
- **A duplicate inbound PDU is dropped** (same source, same SEQ as the one just
  handled). Deliberately not the spec's full replay list: rejecting every SEQ
  below the last would deafen the integration to a node that restarted its
  sequence after a power cut, which is worse than the stale value a replayed
  Status could briefly show.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **The IV Index is tracked from the subnet's Secure Network Beacon.** It was
  frozen at whatever the `.connect` export claimed (usually 0), and the mesh
  moves on without telling the file. A stale IV Index is fatal in silence:
  every PDU we send is discarded and every PDU we receive fails the IVI check,
  with nothing in the logs to explain it. The node announces the truth on every
  connection; the beacon is now authenticated (`k1(NetKey, s1("nkbk"),
  "id128" || 0x01)`), and a new index is adopted, persisted, and restarts the
  SEQ cursor — which is only required to be unique *within* an IV Index. An
  unauthenticated beacon is refused: adopting a forged one would mute the
  integration.
- **Redacted diagnostics** (`diagnostics.py`): the Network ID the integration
  looks for, every 0x1828 advert Home Assistant currently sees, the IV Index
  and SEQ in use, connection state, and each node's element/model composition.
  No key material: the NetKey, AppKey and DeviceKeys the config entry stores
  verbatim are never echoed, which is asserted by a test.

### Fixed

- **The colour-temperature mirror no longer applies to every vendor.**
  Häfele/ThingOS lamps map Light CTL temperature inversely and the workaround
  mirrors the requested Kelvin around the exposed range; applied to a
  spec-conformant lamp it inverted warm and cool end to end. It is now gated on
  the Häfele company identifier.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **A light no longer reports *off* before anything has been read.** The blank
  cache used to claim the lamp was off, which is not a harmless default: any
  other integration acting on that fabricated value — a light group syncing its
  members is enough — switches the lamp off for real, and the invented state
  becomes true. A light is now `unknown` until a read answers or a command is
  issued.

  Note this is a visible behaviour change: an automation testing
  `state == 'off'` will not match while the state is unknown.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **The proxy address filter is now configured on every connection**, which is
  what makes confirmed state possible at all. A Proxy Server starts each
  connection with an accept list that is *empty* (spec §6.5.1) — it forwards
  nothing inbound until told otherwise — so until now no Status reply ever
  reached Home Assistant and every value shown was purely optimistic.
  `MeshController.start()` sets the filter type and claims its own address, so
  a Set is confirmed by the lamp and `get_onoff` / `get_lightness` become
  usable. Best-effort: a proxy that does not answer only costs the
  confirmation, never the connection.

  Hardware-validated on a Häfele Connect Mesh lamp through an ESPHome
  Bluetooth proxy: Status replies now come back in 145–310 ms where nothing
  ever came back before. Note the lamp applies the filter but never sends the
  Filter Status the spec asks for, so the setup is deliberately
  fire-and-forget — both messages are queued ahead of the first command on the
  ordered TX pump, which is what actually guarantees the filter is in place.
- `btmesh.proxy_config`: Set Filter Type / Add Addresses To Filter / Filter
  Status codecs, plus `MeshNode.build_proxy_config_pdu` and
  `MeshNode.parse_proxy_config_pdu` for the `CTL=1, TTL=0` network PDU they
  travel in.
- **Lamps are read, not guessed.** The optimistic cache starts blank, so a lamp
  that was physically lit came back as *off* after every restart and stayed
  wrong until someone touched it. Each light now reads Generic OnOff — and
  Light Lightness when it is on and dimmable — as soon as the mesh becomes
  reachable, and again after every reconnection, which also catches what
  changed while Home Assistant was away. Colour temperature is not read back
  yet. An unanswered read leaves the cache untouched rather than inventing a
  state.

### Fixed

- **A Set no longer reports a mid-fade value.** With Status replies now
  arriving, a lamp answering mid-transition would have dragged the brightness
  slider to the value it was passing through. Set commands return the
  *target* — where the lamp is heading — and fall back to the present value
  only when no transition is running.
- **Availability changes reach the UI immediately.** Entities read the
  coordinator's availability directly, so a change only surfaced through Home
  Assistant's default 30-second entity poll. The coordinator now notifies its
  entities on an availability transition and the lights no longer poll at all.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **A failed connect no longer leaks a live BLE link.** The proxy client is
  connected before the mesh controller is brought up on top of it; if that
  second step failed (GATT subscribe error, connect timeout), the client was
  unreachable from the teardown path and stayed connected — pinning the lamp's
  single proxy slot, locking out both Home Assistant and the vendor app, and
  making the coordinator report an unreachable proxy while itself holding it.
- **A dead mesh transport is now detected instead of being reused forever.** A
  failed GATT write kills the TX pump, which then stops transmitting for good.
  Commands are best-effort, so they simply timed out like an unconfirmed
  Status: the entity stayed *available* while every command silently did
  nothing until the config entry was reloaded. `MeshController` now exposes
  `failed` / `failure`, and the coordinator drops and re-establishes the link
  as soon as the transport dies.

### Added

- The `logo.png` / `logo@2x.png` brand assets, which landed after the `v0.1.0`
  tag and therefore never reached anyone installing the tagged release.

### Changed

- CI verifies that the vendored `custom_components/bluetooth_mesh/btmesh/` copy
  matches `src/btmesh/` (`scripts/sync_vendored_btmesh.py --check`), so a
  forgotten re-vendor cannot ship a stale stack while the suite stays green.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-20

First public release. A pure-Python Bluetooth SIG Mesh stack (`btmesh`) and a
Home Assistant custom integration (`bluetooth_mesh`), validated end-to-end on
real hardware against a Häfele Connect Mesh tunable-white lamp through an
ESPHome Bluetooth proxy.

### Added

- **Mesh stack (`btmesh`)**: k1–k4 derivations, AES-CMAC/AES-CCM, network
  obfuscation; network/transport/access layers; proxy-PDU segmentation and
  reassembly; a provisioner; and a GATT bearer over `bleak` / `habluetooth`
  (works through ESPHome Bluetooth proxies). Validated against the SIG spec
  sample vectors.
- **Home Assistant integration (`bluetooth_mesh`)**: config flow importing a
  ThingOS/Häfele `.connect` network export; a connection coordinator; and a
  `light` platform exposing on/off, brightness, and colour temperature (Light
  CTL) per node composition.
- **Coexistence model**: rides on the network the vendor app already
  provisioned (shared NetKey/AppKey), sending standard app-keyed SIG messages.
- **Kept-alive proxy connection** for instant commands, with a configurable
  keep-alive timeout (options flow) to hand the lamp's single proxy slot back
  to the vendor app when idle. `0` = always connected.
- **Local brand icon** (`brand/`) for Home Assistant ≥ 2026.3.

### Known limitations

- RGB / full-colour lamps (Light HSL / xyL) are not implemented — the reference
  hardware is tunable-white only.
- Optimistic state: brightness/temperature reflect the last command; changes
  made from the vendor app in parallel are not read back until HA's next
  command.
